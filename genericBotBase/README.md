# BotBase

A crappy discord.py@rewrite bot base.

---

### Setting up:

- Install Python 3.6 or higher.
- Install requirements with pip
- Configure the ini
- rewrite .py file if you want (but you'll also need to rename the .ini)
- If you want more stuff, copy a cog, make necessary changes, add it to botbase.py's initial load stuff
