# Open Turnip Bots

These Discord bots are intended to facilitate buying and selling of Turnips in Animal Crossing: New Horizon. They do this by allowing folks to create and join queues when their Daisy Mae prices are low, or their Nook prices are high, sharing the benefits of good prices with everyone on the Discord server! ðŸ˜„

## Work in Progress

These bots are not currently functional. There is a fair amount of work left before they reach Minimum Viable Product status. Expect further documentation at that time!
